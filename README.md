- This is the cooperative project I involved.
- I implemented a calculator for arithmetic, exponential, logarithmic, squaring, bracketing and error checking
- I built the frontend and bridged it to the backend via flask allowing users a calculator on the webpage
- I had unit testing coverage above 100% of backend codes through unittest!
- Technology used: HTML5 + Python3 decimal math Flask + Docker
- I folked this from the original repo.
